Note for future visitors: After taking the distributed operating systems course at uni and getting asked some very tricky questions e.g. what's your consistency model for this file system ? I decided to postpone this project and just use a hard copy of my nas drive which gets sync'd every few moons

Maybe I will come back to this project in the future but I don't really know as I already spent like 2 months working on it not having only the most basic stuff running right know but without considering consistency...
